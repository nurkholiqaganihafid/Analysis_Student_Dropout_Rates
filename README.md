# ðŸ“ŒAnalysis_Student_Dropout_Rates
- This problem is related to the dropout rate of students with undergraduate degrees at higher education institutions. Student dropout has a negative impact on an institution's reputation, enrollment, and finances.
- Data analysis was carried out to build a classification model that can predict students who have the potential to drop out.
- In this analysis, the main goal is to understand the dropout rate, identify related factors, and provide recommendations for increasing student graduation rates.
- This project used the __CRISP-DM__ (*CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining*) methodology.
